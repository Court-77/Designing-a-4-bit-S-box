# 4-Bit S-Box Implementation

This repository contains a Python implementation of a 4-bit S-Box used in symmetric cryptography.

## What Is an S-Box?

An S-Box (substitution box) is a nonlinear transformation used in block ciphers to obscure the relationship between plaintext and ciphertext. This 4-bit S-Box maps a 4-bit input to a 4-bit output.

## Mathematical Background

The S-box function is defined as:
